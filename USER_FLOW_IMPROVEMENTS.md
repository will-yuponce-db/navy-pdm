3. **Direct Navigation**: Automatically filtered to CASREP work orders
4. **Action**: Review and update work order status
5. **Notification**: System confirms status update

### Scenario 2: Daily Maintenance Overview

1. **Dashboard View**: Home page shows fleet maintenance overview
2. **Quick Navigation**: Use Ctrl+1 to go to work orders
3. **Filter Application**: Use Ctrl+C to view only critical work orders
4. **Efficient Review**: Keyboard navigation through work orders

### Scenario 3: PMO Reporting

1. **Readiness Check**: Ctrl+4 to access readiness dashboard
2. **Asset Review**: Ctrl+2 to review asset status
3. **Parts Check**: Ctrl+3 to verify parts availability
4. **Report Generation**: Export data from relevant sections

## Technical Implementation

### Components Added/Modified:

- `WorkflowShortcuts.tsx`: New hook for keyboard navigation
- `NavComponent.tsx`: Added global keyboard shortcuts
- `NotificationSystem.tsx`: Enhanced with critical alert highlighting
- `WorkOrderTable.tsx`: Added URL-based filtering support

### State Management:

- Redux integration for real-time data updates
- URL state management for persistent filtering
- Local state for UI interactions

### Accessibility:

- ARIA labels and roles maintained
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management

## Benefits for Different User Types

### Maintainers:

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:

1. **Role-based Dashboards**: Customized views based on user role
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Multi-criteria filtering with saved presets
3. **Bulk Operations**: Keyboard shortcuts for bulk work order updates
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly shortcuts for tablet users
5. **Analytics Integration**: Usage tracking for workflow optimization

### Performance Considerations:

- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Debounced search and filtering
- Optimized re-renders for real-time updates
